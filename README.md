Anathema Weapon Base for Garry's Mod 13

This is an old project I've worked for years now. I've got no interest in doing much more with this and I'm providing it to the public as a potential base for advanced scripted weaponry.

What's it got?
- Tons of variables
- Weapon "modes" for sprinting, ironsights, crouching, etc. (variables for movement speed, accuracy, etc.)
- Dynamic recoil patterns (increases or decreases based on mode and player velocity)
- Dynamic spread (increases or decreases based on mode and player velocity)
- Potentially great or bad networking (dunno, haven't really tested)
- Lua-based viewmodel animations
- Things
- Stuff

Even if the networking is garbage or if it's full of other problems, chances are you can rip certain aspects out of this as you see fit. *I don't reccomend this for people who aren't up for fixing things.*

I may return to this project later down the road but I'm not satisfied with Garry's Mod in it's current limited state, specifically with animations. I am excited for Garry's vision for a Source 2 variant of Garry's Mod, but that's besides the point.

I'll take pull requests as well, so if you know how to make this project better in anyway, feel free to share.
